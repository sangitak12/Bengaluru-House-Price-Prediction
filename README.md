Before buying a house, there are many factors a potential house buyer considers.A buyer would like to get a rough estimate of the fair price of a house/flat. Also if someone is into house flipping business, predicting the house prices is a crucial component if he/she wants to make profit.By analyzing these Bangalore house data we will determine the approximate price for the houses. Dataset has 9 columns where the target variable is price. The independent variables are factors like number of bathrooms, total sqft area, type of location etc.
